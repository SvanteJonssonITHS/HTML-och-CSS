                        <h3>The importance of forests</h3>
                        <p>
                            Forests are home to well over half the world's
                            land-based species of plants and animals. They have
                            a vital role to play in the fight against global
                            warming. More than a billion people depend on them
                            for their livelihoods and around 300 million people
                            actually live in forests.

                        <h3>The biggest threats</h3>
                        <p>
                            The biggest threats to forests are the expansion of
                            agricultural land, infrastructure developments,
                            mining and even fire. Illegal logging is one of the
                            most serious threats. It’s been responsible for
                            driving some wildlife towards extinction – and it
                            deprives forest communities of vital resources.
                            <br /><br />
                            Forests are crucial in the fight against global
                            warming, by absorbing carbon from the air. But if
                            forests are cleared, or even disturbed, that carbon
                            is released as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
                            gases.

                    <h3>What is Deforestation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to
                        create space for other economic gains such as
                        agriculture, grazing, or using timber for fuel,
                        construction or manufacturing.
